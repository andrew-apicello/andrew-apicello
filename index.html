		<p>
			Discovery exhilarates me. In pursuit of unearthing new patterns and ideas, I have studied science, business, martial arts, music, and engineering. It strikes me that in the moment of understanding even a simple concept, we catch a glimpse of a singular truth. I find myself enthralled in wonder of my surroudings, both physical and philosophical, and hope to spend my whole life exporing this amazing place we call home.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many times, we skip over the most important aspects of each other when introducing ourselves. I wonder how many fantastic people I pass by each day, never knowing their story. This page is for anyone who wants to get to know me a little better. I hope you stay awhile, check out some links, and get to enjoy a beautiful thought today!
