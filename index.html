			<h2>International Space Station Tracker</h2>
		</a>
		<div class="container">
			
			<p>
				This website provides the current location of the international space station (ISS). Additionally, the user can enter his or her location and find the next five best times to view the ISS ranked by duration. This is accomplished using NASA's API which delivers the coordinates of the ISS and also the next 100 times when the ISS's altitude will be greater than 10 degrees over the horizon (90 degrees being the Zenith). The coordinates of the ISS are fed directly into Google's maps API and updated every 120 seconds. Lastly, the weather and daylight are provided for each of the best times listed.

			<h2>Friend Forum: Reimagined Social Media Chat</h2>
		</a>
		<div class="container">
			
			<p>
				In this application, the user is able to login, make a profile, and chat about eight predefined topics as well as in a global conversation. With our link tracking feature, the user will not have to go scrolling through an entire conversation to find a source one of his or her friends shared, as it is automatically stored in a separate list.  Finally, there is a news API to provide a feed of relevant top trending articles within the scope of the predefined topics.

			<h2>RxMinder: Helping Caregivers Help Their Loved Ones</h2>
		</a>
		<div class="container">
			<p>
				The goal of this project was to enable caregivers to set medication reminders for their loved ones via text message. Upon the loved one responding to the text message, the caregiver could see through this webpage if the medication had been properly delivered. If the text reminder was not responded to, then the caregiver would be sent an alert via text and the webpage would update accordingly.

				<h2>Protein Folding with PyRosetta</h2>
			</a>
			<div class="container">
				
				<p>
					I stumbled upon Levinthal's Paradox while studing proten folding at the College of New Jersey. Levinthal asserted that if the amino acids which comprise proteins were to take on all the possible shapes for which they are capable, it would take longer than the age of the universe to find the final shape where it can realistically perform its function. In nature, we find that proteins can fold into their functional shape nearly instantaneously. My fascination and motivation to rectify theory with experimentation lead me to study proteins in graduate school at the University of Virginia.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					While there, I studied the SNARE complex, the proteins responsible for neuronal communication. The Nobel prize for their discovery was awarded the previous year, most notably due to their critical link to neurodegenerative diseases. I jumped at the chance to study the molecular function of the brain.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The SNARE complex drives the release of neurotransmitters, but a divide in the scientific community exists in agreeing how this process is initiated. An early step in this process is for the vesicle containing the neurotransmitters to contact the outer membrane of the neuron (presynaptic membrane). I conducted research investigating the function of Synaptotagmin, a SNARE regulatory protein which bridges the gap bewteen the neurotransmitter containing vesicle and the presynaptic membrane, by calculating the number of lipids in the pre-synaptic membrane neutralized upon binding. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					This project is a simulation of the protein folding of Synaptotagmin used to validate my hypothesis that changes in the protein's orientation upon calcium binding exposed critical amino acids for protein-membrane interactions and driving neuronal communication.

			<h2>Algorithmic Trading with Quantopian</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					Quantopian is an enviornment for designing and backtesting quantitative trading algorithms. After studying finance at the McIntire Business Institute, I began using my skills learned as an academic programmer to explore the technical side of Wall Street.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The strategy employed here calculates the simple moving average of a 30 and 10 day window. The driving alpha is the 10 day moving average crossing over the 10 day moving average, indicating an upward trend. Buy commands are then immidiately executed by the algorithm.
