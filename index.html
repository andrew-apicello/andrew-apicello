			<h2>International Space Station Tracker</h2>
		</a>
		<div class="container">
			
			<p>
				This website provides the current location of the international space station (ISS). Additionally, the user can enter his or her location and find the next five best times to view the ISS. This is accomplished using NASA's API which delivers the coordinates of the ISS and also the next 100 times when the ISS's altitude will be greater than 10 degrees over the horizon (90 degrees being the Zenith). The coordinates of the ISS are fed directly into Google's maps API and updated every 120 seconds.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				All times are given in the user's inputed location's local time. This is accomplished by using Google's timezone API to find the hour difference from GMT given the user's inputted location and account for daylight savings time. Using moment.js, these hours are converted to milliseconds and added to the Unixtime of when the ISS will pass overhead. This is done for the top five passes by longest duration above 10 degrees over the horizon. Nested promises are used to manage the call stream.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As an added touch, a weather API and a sunset API is used to determine if the sky will be clear and it will be night for the best possible viewing conditions. The weather API takes the user location and time of passover as arguments and delivers the weather. The Sunset api will provide a threshold response, day or night, for if the local time of the overhead pass is before astronomical sunrise and after astronomical sunset respecively.</p>

				<h2>Friend Forum: Structuring Social Media Chat</h2>
			</a>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					The inspiration for this project came from a Facebook chat with a group of my college friends. We got onto a riveting topic, but then a casual suggestion for us all to get together derailed the conversation. The limited chat capabilities of social media is frustrating, as groups can only have one conversation at a time. So, my team’s idea was to enable online groups to make their their own threads, so they could structure their conversations the way they want and never miss out on sharing great thoughts.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					As a first step towards creating a space where groups can create customized threads, my team and I developed the Friend Forum. In this application, the user is able to login, make a profile, and chat about eight predefined topics as well as in a global conversation. With our link tracking feature, the user will not have to go scrolling through an entire conversation to find a source one of his or her friends shared, as it is automatically stored in a separate list.  Finally, there is a news API to provide a feed of relevant top trending articles within the scope of the predefined topics.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Although quite similar to other social media outlets, we believe the Friend Forum represents a paradigm shift from mainstream sites. The user’s attention is not guided towards content other users have created about themselves, but rather towards conversations between users. It changes the emphasis of the what is important from the nodes of a web, to the strands connecting them.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The next steps for this project are to have customizable groups and forums rather than predefined ones. The challenge will be to make dynamically added sockets and paths so users can visit each other’s profiles and create their own custom chatrooms. Additionally, we hope to replicate the functionality of the link list with a hashtag list, where any hastaged words will automatically be stored in a list alongside the main chat.

				<h2>Protein Folding with PyRosetta</h2>
			</a>
			<div class="container">
				
				<p>
					I stumbled upon Levinthal's Paradox while studing proten folding at the College of New Jersey. Levinthal asserted that if the amino acids which comprise proteins were to take on all the possible shapes for which they are capable, it would take longer than the age of the universe to find the final shape where it can realistically perform its function. In nature, we find that proteins can fold into their functional shape nearly instantaneously. My fascination and motivation to rectify theory with experimentation lead me to study proteins in graduate school at the University of Virginia.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					While there, I studied the SNARE complex, the proteins responsible for neuronal communication. The Nobel prize for their discovery was awarded the previous year, most notably due to their critical link to neurodegenerative diseases. I jumped at the chance to study the molecular function of the brain.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The SNARE complex drives the release of neurotransmitters, but a divide in the scientific community exists in agreeing how this process is initiated. An early step in this process is for the vesicle containing the neurotransmitters to contact the outer membrane of the neuron (presynaptic membrane). I conducted research investigating the function of Synaptotagmin, a SNARE regulatory protein which bridges the gap bewteen the neurotransmitter containing vesicle and the presynaptic membrane, by calculating the number of lipids in the pre-synaptic membrane neutralized upon binding. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					This project is a simulation of the protein folding of Synaptotagmin used to validate my hypothesis that changes in the protein's orientation upon calcium binding exposed critical amino acids for protein-membrane interactions and driving neuronal communication.

			<h2>Algorithmic Trading with Quantopian</h2>
			<div class="container">
				<p>
					Quantopian is an enviornment for designing and backtesting quantitative trading algorithms. After studying finance at the McIntire Business Institute, I began using my skills learned as an academic programmer to explore the technical side of Wall Street.  
				</p>
				<p>
					The strategy employed here calculates the simple moving average of a 30 and 10 day window. The driving alpha is the 10 day moving average crossing over the 10 day moving average, indicating an upward trend. Buy commands are then immidiately executed by the algorithm.
